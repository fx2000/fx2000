### Hi there 👋, I'm Daniel

After years of running my fair share of startups, I decided to transition out of Product Manager/Owner roles and into more tech-oriented roles that allowed me to continue on my coding journey. I am a Full Stack Developer currently working with JavaScript Technologies across the whole stack, specialized in Front End Development using React.

If you want to know more about me, you can check out my [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/danielfd) where I rant about technology and the occasional superhero movie, or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfduque/) if you feel like getting to know more about my professional journey.

### Tech:  
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, React
* Backend: NodeJS, PHP, Express
* Database: MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB
* Cloud Computing: AWS
